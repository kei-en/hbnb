# hbnb - Models Class System :cl:

hbnb supports the following classes:

- [BaseModel](../models/base_model.py)
- [User](../models/user.py)
- [State](../models/state.py)
- [City](../models/city.py)
- [Amenity](../models/amenity.py)
- [Place](../models/place.py)
- [Review](../models/review.py)

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by one of either two abstracted storage engines,
depending on the call - [FileStorage](../models/engine/file_storage.py) or
[DBStorage](../models/engine/db_storage.py).

### FileStorage

The default mode.

In `FileStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, hbnb
instantiates an instance of `FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage`
object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file
`file.json`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

### DBStorage

Run by setting the environmental variables `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db`.

In `DBStorage` mode, every time the backend is initialized, hbnb
instantiates an instance of `DBStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object
is loaded/re-loaded from the MySQL database specified in the environmental variable
`HBNB_MYSQL_DB`, using the user `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, password `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, and
host `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the
`storage` object is used to register changes in the corresponding MySQL database.
Connection and querying is achieved using SQLAlchemy.

Note that the databases specified for `DBStorage` to connect to must already be
defined on the MySQL server. This repository includes scripts
[setup_mysql_dev.sql](../mysql/setup_mysql_dev.sql) and [setup_mysql_test.sql](../mysql/setup_mysql_test.sql)
to set up `hbnb_dev_db` and `hbnb_test_db` databases in a MySQL server,
respectively.
